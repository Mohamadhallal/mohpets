        <ol type="a">
            <li>Provide Proper Shelter: Ensure that your animals have a safe and comfortable living space appropriate for their species and needs. Keep their living area clean and well-maintained.</li>
            <li>Balanced Diet: Feed your animals a balanced and nutritious diet suitable for their species. Consult with a veterinarian or animal expert to determine the best food for your specific animal.</li>
            <li>Fresh Water: Always provide access to clean and fresh water for your animals. Regularly change the water to keep it clean and free from contaminants.</li>
            <li>Exercise and Enrichment: Make sure your animals have opportunities for exercise and mental stimulation. Provide toys, activities, and space for them to explore and engage in natural behaviors.</li>
            <li>Regular Veterinary Care: Schedule regular check-ups with a veterinarian to monitor your animal's health and address any medical concerns promptly.</li>
            <li>Social Interaction: Many animals are social creatures and require companionship. Ensure they have appropriate socialization with other animals or with you as their caregiver.</li>
            <li>Grooming: Groom your animals regularly to keep their coats clean and free from mats. Some animals may require more frequent grooming than others.</li>
            <li>Safe Environment: Create a safe environment for your animals by removing potential hazards and keeping harmful substances out of their reach.</li>
